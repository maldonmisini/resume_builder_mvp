What it does?

This tool lets you build a professional A4-style CV in minutes:

- Start with one clean minimalist template (personal info, sections for summary, experience, education, skills, certifications, signature)
- Edit every part of the text yourself (planned Future AI assistance for rewriting or improving text sections)
  - Write or change any text (summary, job titles, descriptions, dates...)
  - Add or remove sections related to experience, skills, education... 
  - Change font size, make text bold, italic, underlined
  - Pick text color
- Upload files directly from your computer:
  - Profile photo
  - Certificate or diploma
  - Signature
- Add one clickable personal link (portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, personal website...)
  → the link works even when someone opens the final PDF
- See real-time preview on the right - looks exactly like the printed/saved version
- Click "Apply" → current version saves automatically with date/time
- Go to "My Projects" to see all your saved resumes
- Download selected resume after a quick 'dummy' login screen:
  - PDF
  - JPG
  - PNG
  - WEBP
